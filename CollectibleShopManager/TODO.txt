Short-term changes:
Issue 4: MenuSelectionScreen class needs to handle any inventory type. How to achieve?

- Implement checks for inventory property construction, i.e. string length, integer length, etc
- Allow user to skip entering any "decimal" properties. If user skips these properties then set the default value to 0
- Allow user to remove inventory objects from the command line.
- Allow user to edit individual properties
- Create an iterator to loop over the Inventory properties?
- Update code comments on all files. Reference the Microsoft docs for XML code
- Add other collectible item classes, such as coin, comic book, magazine, book, stamp. 
- Refactor with different project directories / namespaces?
- Add an invoice class.
- Add a DateStamp class for invoices 
- Add a DateStamp class for changes to inventory items, such as sale price or cost
- NOTE: date stamp information should be marked as readonly
- Create server side program to eventually write to / read from the database. Unix-like or Windows?

Long-term changes:
- Rewrite to use SQL database
- Create GUI
- Create HTTP endpoints for client / server communication
- Work with HTTP error codes to inform user if data is invalid
- Write code to account for SQL injections
- Create fullstack web application for an online storefront
- Create task to back up the database
- Allow for Excel import to allow user to rewrite to database?
- Decide on public APIs for integration: ebay, Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, Newegg? Any online retail site that will allow the
user to gather sales data for storage and tracking purposes
