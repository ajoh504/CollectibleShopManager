Short-term changes:
- error: jsonConfig.GetDeserializedList( ) returns a list of objects with null properties. 
- Create an iterator to loop over the Inventory properties (method must be overriden by its child classes -- update: implement 
the GetProperties() method and the PropertyInfo class to achieve this)
- Find a way to reuse the Main method logic for other collectible items
- Update code comments on all files.
- Add other collectible item classes, such as coin, comic, magazine, book
- Refactor CollectibleItem class. Make it a non-abstract class so that it can be instantiated. Rename this class as Inventory  

Long-term changes:
- Rewrite to use SQL database
- Create GUI
- Create fullstack web application for an online storefront
- Create task to back up the database
- Allow for Excel import to allow user to rewrite to database?
- Decide on public APIs for integration: ebay, Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, Newegg? Any online retail site that will allow the
user to gather sales data for storage and tracking purposes
