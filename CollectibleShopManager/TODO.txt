Short term:
- Create an iterator to loop over the Inventory properties (method must be overriden by its child classes)
- Find a way to reuse the Main method logic for other collectible items
- Update code comments on all files.
- Add other collectible item classes, such as coin, comic, magazine
- Refactor CollectibleItem class. Make it a non-abstract class so that it can be instantiated. Rename this class as Inventory 
to reflect its generic purpose. All child classes of Inventory will be considered "special" classes, i.e. collectible items 
that have unique properties or methods. Any object instantiated directly as Inventory will be considered a generic item, i.e. 
an item with no special properties. 

Long term:
- Rewrite to use SQL database
- Create GUI
- Create task to back up the database
- Allow for Excel import to allow user to rewrite to database?
- Decide on public APIs for integration: ebay, Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, Newegg? Any online retail site that will allow the
user to gather sales data for storage and tracking purposes
